# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We currently support the latest release and the `main` branch.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please **do not** open a public issue.

Instead, use GitHub Security Advisories:

1. Go to the repository's **Security** tab.
2. Click **"Report a vulnerability"**.
3. Provide a clear description, impact, and reproduction steps.

We will acknowledge the report as soon as possible and coordinate a fix and disclosure.
